<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Input: sentences = [&ldquo;alice and bob love leetcode&rdquo;, &ldquo;i think so too&rdquo;, &ldquo;this is great thanks very much&rdquo;]
Output: 6
Explanation:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The first sentence, &ldquo;alice and bob love leetcode&rdquo;, has 5 words in total.</li>
<li>The second sentence, &ldquo;i think so too&rdquo;, has 4 words in total.</li>
<li>The third sentence, &ldquo;this is great thanks very much&rdquo;, has 6 words in total.
Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, which has 6 words.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Input: sentences = [&ldquo;please wait&rdquo;, &ldquo;continue to fight&rdquo;, &ldquo;continue to win&rdquo;]
